ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Kristoffer. I like to build infrastructure things and business value. 

I'm a hands-on infrastructure architect and technical leader with more than two decades of experience across agencies, fintech, the public sector, startups and entrepreneurship.

Currently I work with teams and stakeholders at JP/Politikens Hus, where I:
- Help define and implement the company's technical strategy
- Modernize legacy platforms and infrastructure
- Analyze and plan hybrid infrastructure migrations
- Build and maintain infrastructure for digital product teams
- Focus on strategies for cost saving, security, and emission control
- Collaborate across businesses and stakeholders to secure buy-in and define technical vision


This is some of the tools I often use:


| Purpose              | Thing                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Infrastructure       | <ul><li>Amazon Web Services</li><li>Microsoft Azure</li><li>VMWare</li></ul> <ul><li>Terraform</li><li>CloudFormation</li></ul> |
| General scripting    | `sh`
| CI/CD pipelines      | GitHub Actions
| Issue tracking       | Jira, ServiceNow, GitHub Projects
| Version control      | GitHub, GitLab
